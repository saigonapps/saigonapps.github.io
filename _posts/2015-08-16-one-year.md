> To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often. Winston Churchill

Time flying like a rocket. It is one year now for our startup with VN Cam, Timely Lapsed 128, TrumMP3, MV Play, Who Am I, Money Map and Carleak ready to go (7 apps). The most valuable things we gain are:

- acknowleging feedbacks of users
- keeping focus and being in flow
- frameworking in agile way.

[Money map? Exploring Vietnam by scanning banknotes] [app2]

Happy making apps and enjoy the coming days!
