Traditionally I am used to  write out some things for the very first new day of new year in Lunar calendar. We wish you a happy and prosperous new year. Our first product in 2015 is Trum MP3, in which Trum means Master.

Why do we need another MP3 app?

We collected 20K comments of users from Zing, NhacCuaTui and ChiaSeNhac and figured out some interesting sweetpot. That is people love music but they looking for searching and storing MP3 in their devices as well.

So far, Trum MP3 is new search app on top of Zing MP3 + NhacCuaTui + ChiaSeNhac. Music lovers are able to search High quality songs, get unlimited number of files into their pocket and play seamlessly everywhere even without Internet connection.
